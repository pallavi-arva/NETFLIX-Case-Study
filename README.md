This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Netflix's extensive library of over 8,800 movies and TV shows. By transforming raw data into visual insights, the dashboard explores content distribution, regional availability, and maturity rating trends to understand how Netflix’s catalog has evolved over the years.

Technical Workflow
Data Cleaning (Power Query): Handled missing values in Director, Cast, and Country columns. Standardized the Date Added field and extracted the Month and Year for temporal analysis.

Data Modeling: Established relationships between content types, genres, and ratings.

Feature Engineering (DAX): * Created measures for Total Titles, Total Movies, and Total TV Shows.

Developed a "Rating Category" metric to group content into Adult, Teen, and Kids segments.

Visual Design: Implemented a dark-themed UI consistent with Netflix's brand identity.

Key Insights & Visualizations
Content Split: A donut chart showing the 70/30 split between Movies and TV Shows.

Global Footprint: A filled map visual highlighting content production by country (USA and India being major contributors).

Growth Trends: A line chart depicting the massive surge in content added to the platform after 2015.

Genre Popularity: A bar chart identifying "International Movies" and "Dramas" as the most frequent genres.

Maturity Ratings: A treemap analyzing the dominance of TV-MA and TV-14 ratings, indicating a lean toward adult and teen audiences.

Business Recommendations
Diversify Genres: While Dramas are dominant, there is a growing trend in "Documentaries" that could be leveraged for niche market growth.

Targeted Regional Content: Since North America is saturated, focusing on local-language content in Asia and Europe (as shown in the geographic map) is key to subscriber retention.
